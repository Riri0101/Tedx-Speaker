# Tedx-Speaker
Ever dreamed of giving a TED Talk but don’t want the hassle of writing scripts or stepping on stage? This AI-powered tool generates engaging, humorous, and human-like TED Talks—and even converts them into AI-generated speech


This project utilizes Google Gemini AI (gemini-pro) to generate structured and engaging TED Talk scripts based on user-provided topics. The generated text is then converted into AI speech using Google TTS (gTTS), providing a seamless text-to-speech experience.

How It Works
User Inputs a Topic – Any TED Talk idea of their choice.
AI Generates a Script – Using Google Gemini AI for engaging, structured content.
AI Converts Text to Speech – Using Google TTS or ElevenLabs for realistic voice output.
This tool simplifies speech creation, making high-quality TED Talk-style presentations accessible with minimal effort.
